### What I learned

I learnt how to use the font face property for the first time. I also learnt how to use the box-shadow property.

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Figtree';
    src: url(/assets/fonts/Figtree-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: italic;
}


:root {
    --BGCOLOR: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    --BOXSHADOW: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
    --BGCOLORM: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --FONTCOLOR: hsl(0, 0%, 50%);
}
```
